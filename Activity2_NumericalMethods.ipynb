    "This unit is all about computing the solutions of differential equations *numerically*. We'll need to introduce a few programming concepts to make this work.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loops**: A loop is a way to repeat the same code many times. This is important when solving differential equations numerically because the process is inherantly iterative. We break the problem down into tiny steps and we use the differential equation to tell us how each step should progress. \n",
    "2. **Functions**: It's useful to separate out bits of the solution process into independent pieces. One nice way to do that is to make each part a *function* that just knows how to handle that one part.\n",
    "3. **Lists**: We can use lists to save the results of the calculation as the process continues.\n",
    "4. **Arrays**: An array is a kind of high-performance list of all the same kinds of values.\n",

    "Note that this loop does exactly the same thing as the for loop, but takes more typing. You have to \"set up\" the variables in the condition beforehand. You also need to manually adjust the variables used in the condition each time through the loop. Sometimes, this is a natural side effect of the calculation, so it's no *extra* work. The good thing about a `while` loop is that it's very general. There's nothing a `for` loop can do that a `while` loop can't. However, it takes more bookkeeping and typing. This is the price we pay for generality. In the context of differential equations, we'll more often be using the `while` loop, but not always."
